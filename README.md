[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)

* Standard compliant React Native App Utilizing [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)


## How to contribute

Create a new fork into your own repo. This will be your master and where you add files. This is done from github.

You will then clone your own repo using github or git. This will be your new file base.

Create a new remote and call it upstream linking to this repo.

'''
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bjkoehle/ChoreWheelApp.git
'''

Then create a new pull request from your repo when you want to merge into master. This is from the repo that you forked.

Do not push and pull from my master repo. Please ask if you need help or are having trouble.

## :arrow_up: How to Setup

**Step 1:** git clone your forked repo:

**Step 2:** cd to the cloned repo:

**Step 3:** Install the Application with `npm install`

## :arrow_forward: How to Run App

1. cd to the repo
2. Run Build for either OS
  * for iOS
    * run `react-native run-ios`
  * for Android
    * Run Emulator(or use phone)
    * run `npm start` in one terminal ** this command is not 100% necessary but sometimes the one below does not start the server **
    * run `react-native run-android` in another


## Possible issues:

Building the app:
* You have not accepted/signed a license for one of the SDK tools
  1. Open android SDK manager
  2. Download any missing SDK tools that were specified and make sure to accept license.
  3. If you have already downloaded the specified tool: uninstall, reinstall and make sure you have accepted the license.
  4. Still not working? Have you set the ANDROID_SDK_HOME and ANDROID_HOME system variables?(Look up tutorials. TODO: add help here)
* Could not find tools.jar in $JAVA_INSTALL\lib
  1. Make sure that you have the latest version of *JDK* installed.
  2. Create a enviornment variable called JAVA_HOME and link it to your JDK install folder.

Runtime:
* Look up issue online or ask me, most common is cannot connect to bridge batch. I know a few methods to solve this so please ask.
* If you are using a physical device you can shake the device in the app to bring up developer menu. Some of the options here may help.

## :no_entry_sign: Standard Compliant

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

**To Lint on Commit**

This is implemented using [ghooks](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks). There is no additional setup needed.

**Bypass Lint**

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding `--no-verify` to your commit command.

**Understanding Linting Errors**

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard.  [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).

## :closed_lock_with_key: Secrets

This project uses [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native. You can store API keys
and other sensitive information in a `.env` file:

```
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

and access them from React Native like so:

```
import Secrets from 'react-native-config'

Secrets.API_URL  // 'https://myapi.com'
Secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  // 'abcdefgh'
```

The `.env` file is ignored by git keeping those secrets out of your repo.
